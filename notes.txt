It appears that with I ran the smaller arrays, the runtime difference between unshift and push functions isn't very noticeable. However, the push method
performed at a faster runtime. As we get to much larger arrays, the unshift method appears to perform much faster. This is due to the fact one method runs 
on constant time vs linear.

//Research: 

The time complexity of push() is O(1) where as for unshift() is it O(n). Unshift has to increment all elements that are already present in the array. Push() has 
to insert an element at the end of the array, therefore none of the array elements index needs to change.
